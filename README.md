        #Actually there is a typo in test_main.py that is:-
# in last test case     
# graph4 = [ [(1, 1), (2, 1)],
# [(1, 1), (2, 1)],
# [(1, 1), (2, 1)],
# [(3, 1)],  
# []
# ]
    #  assert longest_path(graph4) == 3 which is a typo the correct output should be:- 
        #  assert longest_path(graph4) == 2 This is the correct one
